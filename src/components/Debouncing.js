/*
Debouncing is a technique where we can monitor the time delay of user action and once that delay reaches our predetermined threshold we can can make the function call.
Throttling is a technique where we make the function call in a predetermined time interval irrespective of continuous user actions.
Even though both debouncing and throttling seems like similar, both have their own use-cases. Itâ€™s not recommended to use throttling logic in search bar and we we cannot use debouncing in shooting game scenario or browser resizing or onScroll events.
